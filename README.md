# Pluralsight Scraper

There are some tools to watch Pluralsight videos offline which include [Pluralsight Offline Player](https://www.pluralsight.com/product/downloads) in which you can watch videos offline, but you can't share videos or copy to other devices because of encryption. 

There are some open source tools available for downloading videos in unencrypted format like mp4 and mkv.

some of them are from [Github](https://github.com/) which are listed below

1 : [Pluralsight Scraper from knyzorg](https://github.com/knyzorg/pluralsight-scraper)

2 : [Pluralsight Scraper from stormix](https://github.com/Stormix/pluralsight_scraper)

3 : [Pluralsight Scraper from zer0nka](https://github.com/zer0nka/pluralsight-scraper)

4 : [Pluralsight Scraper from AhmedMoalla](https://github.com/AhmedMoalla/PluralsightScraper)

5 : [Pluralsight Scraper from matthewzar](https://github.com/matthewzar/pluralsight-scraper)

all of this might look same but each of them is unique and works differently.
If you have problems with any one of them you can simply use other.
